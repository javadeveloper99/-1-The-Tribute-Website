# The-Tribute-Website 
        I created a simple tribute website for Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam using just HTML and CSS.
        It features a clean design with a heartfelt message honoring his legacy and contributions to India.
        The page includes one inspiring photo of Dr. Kalam, reflecting his wisdom and vision.
        I kept the design minimal yet impactful, ensuring a smooth user experience.
        This small project is my way of remembering and celebrating the Missile Man of India,
        who continues to inspire millions with his words and work. Let me know if you'd like to see or improve it!
